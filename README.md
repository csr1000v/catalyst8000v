# catalyst8000v

The purpose of this repo is to provide resources to connect a Cisco Catalyst 8000v to AnyConnect SSL VPN.



## SSL VPN Profile
The SSL VPN Profile is stored in an .xml file. This file is a template and the follow changes within the file need to be updated for a new setup:
1. The HostName in line 45 is currently `<HostName>CiscoCatalyst8000v</HostName>`, which can be any string to name the new AnyConnect SSL VPN

2. The HostAddress in line 46 is currently ```<HostAddress>13.66.194.122</HostAddress>```, which needs to be the IP address of a newly created Cisco Catalyst 8000v
